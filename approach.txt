Hi, this is a summary of my approach to the problem:

I progressively developed the sql and analyzed performance. After analyzing the files and problem statement I decided to 
 use a database and stored procedure and then created tables and scripts to load the data. Once loaded, I could query the 
 data to understand it better. I then worked on the query to retrieve recommendations, improving over iterations. 
 Its certainly not perfect and I believe the query can be improved given more time.

I believe loading the data into database tables and using the power of the database to query the data provides the best 
solution for this problem because:
 - a database provides a good foundation for future growth as more data is added and changed
 - a database provides tools and means to analyze fetch algorithm performance (e.g. explain and profiling)
 - a database allows for easily adding other criteria such as a users personal preferences to include 
    in providing recommendations in the future

I decided to implement the query as a stored procedure to provide best performance and maintainability. It can easily support
 multiple clients and centralizes the logic. The fetch query can be improved without requiring changes to server code (or 
 other clients).
 
I used a simple php script implemented as a Rest api for serving recommendations. I tried to make as Rest like as possible,
 with more time there are frameworks to make the urls restful. Please see comments in script.
I created a simple HTML web app to show how to easily use. Excuse the simple layout.
I tested on IE8 and Chrome.



Data Analysis
-------------
I found that supersize@subrational.com attendeded 1 event which was dated 2011-11-10. Not 
 the Nov 1st date in the Instructions. So if you look for an event in the past Nov 1st you won't find
 any for supersize@subrational.com.

Analyzing the data I found: user supersize@subrational.com (id: d421fd74-b2bf-4a15-9984-7954233f13e6) went to 1 
event (id: fc361414-c435-4a85-8be2-d03512c39973). That event has an event date of Nov 10 (after Nov 1st)
25 other users also attended the same event (id: fc361414-c435-4a85-8be2-d03512c39973)
	select * from attendees where event_id = 'fc361414-c435-4a85-8be2-d03512c39973'

Here's a sampling of the user ids who also attended the same event and whom we use for recommendations. 
Examining the data I double checked that events they attended were coming up in recommendations.

user id:                              email                         events attended
0551f79f-41f2-481e-b8dc-7cbd6498832f  pediceled@thinkling.com also  attended just that same event but no others
5c55c7ed-f428-4a3c-9bf9-1647dfe214fa  fundamental@cumaphytic.com    attended just that same event but no others
422e3ae6-9cc5-4567-aa8f-22e1fc0d2a92  tough@melene.com              attended that and 2 other events (these are recommended): 
                               9e4492e0-df36-44a6-8421-226bb9cb2db3, 59d4bbac-9adc-4220-ad2d-7e50f2c529f6

                               a1bf91fa-c666-47a3-a2a6-f15139be1d5b

However of the 29 events recommended, only the last 4 have dates on or after 2011-11-11, per this query:

Intructions
-----------
Recommendations are generated under the assumption that users that attend the
same event have similar taste. Once we know that two users have attended the 
same event in the past, we can make a reasonable guess that they may be
interested in attending the same events in the future. In other words, their
interest in events will likely coincide. 

Included are three files, events.csv, users.csv, and attendees.csv. These 
files contain, respectively, events, users and attendees (the last is just a
mapping of users to events). The events here cover a time span from October
15th, 2011 to November 15th, 2011. Assume that today's date is November 1st,
2011. Events before today are said to have already happened, and events after
today will happen in the future. Based on the event date, rows in the attendee
file either refer to events that a user has attended, or events that a user
plans to attend.

One of the users included here is supersize@subrational.com. Based on the data
in these files, generate the list of recommended events that this user may be
interested in attending. Use whatever algorithm you choose to generate the best
recommendations. These instructions are intentionally vague on purpose. There
is no right answer, and you are free to creatively solve the problem however
you see fit.
